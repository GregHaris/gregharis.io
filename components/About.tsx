          Hey <span className="wave">ðŸ‘‹</span>! My name is GrÃ«g HÃ¤ris. I'm a dedicated software developer
          passionate about crafting innovative web applications. Having recently
          transitioned from a career in Real Estate as an AirBnB Property
          Manager/ Host to focusing full-time on Software Development, I've
          quickly gained proficiency in various web technologies.
        </p>
        <p className="text-lg mb-4">
          My expertise lies in CSS, JavaScript, React, TypeScript, and Node.js.
          I thrive on continuous learning and am always eager to explore new
          technologies and methodologies to deliver exceptional results. I'm
          particularly skilled in problem-solving and enjoy tackling complex
          challenges.
        </p>
        <p className="text-lg">
          You can find me in the gym, exploring nature, or losing myself in a
          good book when I'm not coding.
